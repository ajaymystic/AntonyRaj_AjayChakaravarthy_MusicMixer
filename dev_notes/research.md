# Dev Notes – Music Mixer Project

## 🎯 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a basic interactive web-based music mixer. Users will be able to drag and drop audio tracks or loops, control volume, and play/pause individual sounds. This project is a collaboration between a designer and a developer.

## 🔍 Research Summary

### 🧩 Audio Features
- Exploring the **Web Audio API** for playing and mixing sounds.
- Basic audio elements tested using `<audio>` tags and `AudioContext`.
- Considering **Howler.js** for simpler volume and play control.
- Will add play/pause buttons and a volume slider.

### 🖱️ Drag and Drop
- Using HTML native drag and drop events:
  - `dragstart`, `dragover`, `drop`
- Target is to drag sample loops into drop zones (music tracks).

### 🎛️ Planned Interactivity
- Grid layout for loop zones.
- Ability to mute/unmute tracks.
- Possibly add timeline-based playback if time allows.
