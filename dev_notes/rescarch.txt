Dev Notes â€“ Music Mixer Project

Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to create an interactive web-based music mixer. Users will be able to drag and drop audio tracks, play/pause music, and control volume. The project is a collaboration between a developer and a designer.

Research Summary:

Audio Features:
- Researched how to use the HTML5 <audio> element and Web Audio API.
- Explored libraries like Howler.js and Tone.js for future expansion.
- Initial testing includes basic audio playback, pause, and volume control using JavaScript.

Drag and Drop:
- Using native HTML5 drag-and-drop events like dragstart, dragover, and drop.
- Users will drag sample tracks into drop zones on the mixer interface.

Planned Features:
- Grid layout with loop drop zones.
- Volume slider and play/pause buttons.
- Multiple audio tracks can be dropped and triggered separately.
- Mute/unmute functionality (if time allows).

Tools & Stack:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git and GitHub (with main, design, and development branches)
- Visual inspiration collected using Pinterest and Figma

Current Progress:
- Project folder structure has been set up
- Basic HTML and CSS layout done
- Audio testing started in script.js
- Drag-and-drop logic in planning phase

Next Steps:
- Implement drag and drop functionality for tracks
- Add event listeners for play/pause/volume
- Style controls to match design inspiration
- Finalize visual layout and test responsiveness
